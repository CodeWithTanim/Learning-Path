# What We Learned on Day 2

I watched some interesting programs made by [CodeWithHarry](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry/) in his [100 Days of Python Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg) on YouTube.

### The Projects I Saw:
1. [Jarvis Virtual Assistant](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry/100-days-of-code-youtube/tree/main/02-Day2-Application-of-Python/1.%20Jarvis%20Virtual%20Assistant)
2. [Love Calculator (Fun)](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry/100-days-of-code-youtube/tree/main/02-Day2-Application-of-Python/2.%20Love%20Calculator)
3. [Face Recognition](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry/100-days-of-code-youtube/tree/main/02-Day2-Application-of-Python/3.%20Face%20Recognition)
4. [Flappy Bird Game](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry/100-days-of-code-youtube/tree/main/02-Day2-Application-of-Python/4.%20Flappy%20Bird%20Game)

These projects really inspired me to start building my own and keep learning so I can achieve success in my coding journey. ðŸš€
